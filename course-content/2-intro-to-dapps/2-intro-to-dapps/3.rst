Stage 3: Token Deployment
=========================

`Video Tutorial <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sdLtnunj3crUAMX6Q_qqYOITJ0Z94Ee0>`_

.. note::
  - A default, and required, initial migration script(src/migrations/1_initial_migration.js), has been included. Do *not* remove this script.

1. Write the Deployment Script

- Create a new file in order to deploy the token, ``src/migrations/2_deploy_contracts.js``

  - Simply right-click on the migrations directory and select ``New File`` from the drop down menu to create the new file.
  - Select ``File`` => ``Save As`` and then enter the name of the file: ``2_deploy_contracts.js``, click the ``Save`` button in the bottom right corner.

**Time to add some code to this new file!**

- Import the token's artifacts, line 1

.. code-block:: javascript

  const Token = artifacts.require("./Token.sol");

- Define the owner account, line 2 
  - Note that the ``truffle migrate`` command exposes the ``web3`` object globally which is connected to your ganache node
    and therefore has access to all of the default 10 accounts.

.. code-block:: javascript

  const owner = web3.eth.accounts[0];

- Utilize truffle's deployer object in order to deploy an instance of the token, line 4-6
  - This deployer is a utility that ``truffle`` provides within its framework to make sending ``contract creation`` transactions as easy as the one line below!
  - This function will be exported so that it may be executed by the ``truffle migrate`` command

.. code-block:: javascript

  module.exports = deployer => {
    deployer.deploy(Token, { from: owner });
  }

.. important::

  Don't forget to save!

  This may be done either by selecting ``File`` => ``Save`` or via ``ctrl+s`` on the keyboard.

2. Deploy your Token

.. important::

  Now back within your terminal window where the ``truffle test`` command was recently run...

  Ensure you are still in the ``src`` directory!

.. code-block:: bash

  truffle migrate --reset

- *Example output:*

.. code-block:: console

  # truffle migrate --reset
  Using network 'development'.

.. important::

  You just sent your first *contract creation* transaction via the ``truffle`` framework, well done!

  As above, the ``Token`` contract has been created at address: ``0xd58c6b5e848d70fd94693a370045968c0bc762a7``, note that yours will 
  almost certainly be created at a different address!  

  Also the ``Migrations`` contract was created which is nothing to worry about but just a utility the ``truffle`` framework uses to monitor
  the status of your transactions.

  If you have a look back at ganache and select on the ``Transactions`` tab you will see the ``Contract Creation`` transactions that were sent
  and lots of other data too!
