3.0 A High Stakes Game
======================

**OK how about a friendly wager!**

24. Add a storage variable to hold the placed wagers, line 12

::

    mapping(address => uint256) public wagers_;

25. Add a function to allow the players to place a wager, line 82-86

::

    function placeWager() external payable {
        require(msg.sender == player1_ || msg.sender == player2_, "Not a valid player.");
        wagers_[msg.sender] = msg.value;
    }

26. Update the logic if a winner is found to transfer all the value to them, within the ``takeTurn`` function line 43

::

    msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);

27. Update the logic to refund the value if a draw has occured, within the ``takeTurn`` function line 46-47

::

    player1_.transfer(wagers_[player1_]);
    player2_.transfer(wagers_[player2_]);

**Go play!  Earn some ETH.**

Homework!

- What happens when a new game wants to be started in the same contract?
- How to allow this?  When to allow this?  Reset storage variables?
