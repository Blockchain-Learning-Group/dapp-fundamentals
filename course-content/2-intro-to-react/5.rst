5. Building out Your Products
=================================

- Great work so far!  However, the application is not looking overly interesting just yet.  In this section you will build out the ``<Product>`` component.

- |semantic_ui|

  .. |semantic_ui| raw:: html

    <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a>
  
  is being used as a styling library which has been linked in your ``index.html`` file for you. Therefore, the ``className`` reference in several of the
  elements below are in fact utilizing classes and styling that is provided by Semantic.

- Begin by extending the content that is returned by the component in it's ``render()`` function. 
  You will add an image, a title, a description, and an image of who submitted the product.

  .. code-block:: html

    class Product extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return (
          <div className='item'>
            <div className='image'>
              <img src='images/products/image-aqua.png' />
            </div>
            <div className='middle aligned content'>
              <div className='description'>
                <a>YOUR PRODUCT NAME</a>
                <p>NEW FANCY PRODUCT OF YOUR OWN</p>
              </div>
              <div className='extra'>
                <span>Submitted by:</span>
                <img className='ui avatar image' src='images/avatars/liz.png' />
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        );
      }
    }

- The image links in the component above map to the images that have been provided for you within the ``/images`` folder.
- The product image: ``<img src='images/products/image-aqua.png' />`` and the submitted image: ``<img className='ui avatar image' src='images/avatars/liz.png' />``
  both exist within their respective folders ``images/products/`` and ``images/avatars/``, feel free to add new images of your own and update these paths accordingly!
